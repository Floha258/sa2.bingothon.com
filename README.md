This is the SMS Bingo League Website, written in Next.JS, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.

## Getting Started

After cloning, install dependencies with `yarn`. Then, use `yarn dev` to inner loop develop, and `yarn build` to build. Currently we deploy to github pages with the workflow and Next.JS's static export.

## TODO

Everything lol
